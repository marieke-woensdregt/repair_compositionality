    "* **Diversify signal**: make the individual segments that each signal consists of as distinct as possible. For example, in the language shown below, all four signals can be distinguished from each other in all cases where one character is blocked by noise. This strategy however is not compatible with compositionality, because it relies on making each of the segments as distinct from each other as possible. That means these languages are necessarily holistic, an therefore less easy to learn (so they would do less well under a pressure for learnability).\n",
