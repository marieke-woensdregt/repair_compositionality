# repair_compositionality
We explore how the evolution of a compositional language interacts with other-initiated repair.

The Jupyter notebook "evolution_compositionality_under_noise.ipynb", included in this repository, contains the (timestamped) motivation and rationale behind this model and all our design decisions. An interactive version of this Jupyter notebook can be found here: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/marieke-woensdregt/repair_compositionality/115444ab917683e54cf944546029e50765257e33?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fevolution_compositionality_under_noise.ipynb
