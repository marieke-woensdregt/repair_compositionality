# repair_compositionality
We explore how the evolution of a compositional language interacts with other-initiated repair.

The Jupyter notebook "evolution_compositionality_under_noise.ipynb", included in this repository, contains the (timestamped) motivation and rationale behind this model and all our design decisions. An interactive version of this Jupyter notebook can be found here (click the binder badge): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/marieke-woensdregt/repair_compositionality/master?labpath=evolution_compositionality_under_noise.ipynb)
